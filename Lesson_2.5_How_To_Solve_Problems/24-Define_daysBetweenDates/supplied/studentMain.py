# Given your birthday and the current date, calculate your age in days. 
# Compensate for leap days. 
# Assume that the birthday and current date are correct dates (and no time travel). 
# Simply put, if you were born 1 Jan 2012 and todays date is 2 Jan 2012 
# you are 1 day old.
#
# Hint
# A whole year is 365 days, 366 if a leap year.
